# Case Study
---
Lots of people choose to be freelancers today. Some quit their job other do it in their free time. One thing that is for
sure is that it’s a growing phenomenon which benefits from the communication infrastructure that we have today, so it might
become, in the future, the way we will work, well at least in some areas. 

Digital projects are the most popular on freelance platforms: programming, video editing, digital art, translations etc.
It’s never been easier to find the projects that you would enjoy doing and getting paid for them. Everyone is good at 
something, however sometimes is hard to find clients to work for.


One thing people like is to work on their own projects and ideas with no time constraint or financial pressure and then
just sell them and be set for life. However often times those ideas don’t come very easily so choosing to work on someone
else’s project becomes a more viable option, but the payment for that comes only one single time. However what if the
employer would want to make more money out of the project by selling it further on a marketplace to potential buyers?  
One thing that would be even better is to not pay the freelancer and instead make him a partner who gets a fair share when
the project is sold. It becomes a long term investment.


For employers time and money are precious, so how would their project be finished faster? Chances are the project they are 
trying to find freelancers for has already been made. Wouldn’t be nice for them to browse a catalog of projects and find 
what they need?


FreelanceJoy offers something for everyone by presenting a platform with two main components: a freelancing component and a
marketplace. Everyone can add projects to be sold on the marketplace. One feature of our platform is the possibility for 
the freelancer and the employer to make more money out of the project if they both decide to put it on the marketplace and
split the revenue once it has been bought by someone and thus passive income is generated. What this does is to encourage
people to come up with ideas, find skilled freelancer to create projects around them and then sell them further without 
investing any money in them. Sometimes the freelancer might not want this so the employer pays him but he can put the 
project on the marketplace by himself.
